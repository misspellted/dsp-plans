# Objective

Cluster: [3947-0111](../clusters/3947-0111/details.md)

As I got more familiar with the planet and progression, I decided to focus on early game blueprints.

## Research

As a result of the focus on early game blueprints, the first queue of research was updated, swapping out Thermal Power for Upgraded Logistics System, to access the splitter building now used even in the first few blueprints.

### First Queue

* Electromagnetism
* Automatic Metallurgy
* Basic Logistics System
* Basic Assembling
* Electromagnetic Matrix
* Mecha Core Lv1
* Mass Construction Lv1
* Upgraded Logistics System

### Second Queue

* Thermal Power
* Electromagnetic Drive
* Engine
* Steel Smelting
* Smelting Purification
* Fluid Storage Encapsulation
* High-Efficiencey Plasma Control
* Reclamation

### Third Queue

* Mechanical Frame Lv1
* Inventory Capacity Lv1
* Communication Control Lv1
* Drone Engine Lv1
* Drive Engine Lv1
* Universe Exploration Lv1
* Mass Construction Lv2
* Energy Circuit Lv1

## Blueprints

This is the run where [MISS-3's](./MISS-3.md) blueprints were refined and eventually replaced.

### Milestones

I cemented the idea of saving milestone deployments of blueprints:

* Milestone 0: Completing first queue of research
* Milestone 1: Replacing starting base with mining and smelting facilities, as well as intial eletromagnetic science production and research.
* Milestone 2: Starting to ramp up production, in preparation for a hub.
* Milestone 3: Initial hub deployment, from Electromatnetism through Upgraded Logistics System (sans Mk.II conveyor belts)
* Milestone 4: In progress, likely unlocking initial red science production and research
