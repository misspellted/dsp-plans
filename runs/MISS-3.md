# Objective

Cluster: [3947-0111](../clusters/3947-0111/details.md)

Really started getting into the flow of the achievement, although accomplishing it is quite far off.

## Research

I also re-established the idea of research queues, from earlier attempts of getting the achievement. Each queue consists of 8 research topics.

### First Queue

Goal: Unlock early game blueprints.

* Electromagnetism
* Automatic Metallurgy
* Basic Logistics System
* Basic Assembling
* Electromagnetic Matrix
* Mecha Core Lv1
* Mass Construction Lv1
* Thermal Power

### Second Queue

Goal: Unlock resources for resource-based upgrades.

* Electromagnetic Drive
* Engine
* Steel Smelting
* Smelting Purification

(I don't have the remainder of the queue - I believe at this point my focus shifted to blueprints in sandbox mode..)

## Blueprints

The early game blueprints I've taken for this run have largely been replaced by those in [MISS-4](./MISS-4.md).

I also started considering milestones as deployments of blueprints:

* Milestone 0: Completing first queue of research
* Milestone 1: Replacing starting base with mining and smelting facilities, as well as intial eletromagnetic science production and research.
* Milestone 2: Starting to ramp up production, in preparation for a hub.

However, I believe they could be recreated from MISS-3 planning sandbox saves...
