Cluster: [3947-0111](../clusters/3947-0111/details.md)

Started getting pretty good idea of the starting base layout as well, namely identifying the common drop points for the first mining machine and wind turbine.

Like... try and do a regular play through to start thinking about the different types of blueprints to collect?

I believe I have a couple of saves for this run, but eventually, it became untenable, and so I started the next run.

I don't believe I saved any blueprints? I'll double check.
