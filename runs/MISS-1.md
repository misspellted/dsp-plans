# Objective

MISS-1 is the first attempt at playing a Mission Impossible achievement run on [Santa's Secret (Mission Impossible on Santa's Secret -> MISS)](../clusters/3947-0111/details.md).

I can't find any notes at the moment, and I don't ahve the game up and running to see if I have any saves, but if/when I do, I'll update from here.

Mostly just awestruck at the sheer luck of finding a cluster with a starting planet that has a landing at the North Pole.

Oh, and also.. no starting copper ore or iron ore veins either! Weird!

Likely I think just messing around, not really aiming for the objective, but starting to get a lay of the land, as it were.
